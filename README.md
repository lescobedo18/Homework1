I named all my variables first 
then i started a for loop to go through all the sheets in the workbook
i found the ticker and total volume successfully 
i created a new if to find the percent change 
i calculated the yearly change 
i created another if for the color placement 

my mistakes and things im confused in:
i couldnt figure out what i did wrong with the yearly change
i essentially got the right number but in percent form and with wrong decimal place 
i coudlnt figure out how to remove the percent sign and i dont know how it got there in the first place 
i also couldnt figure out how to get the correct decimal placement 
i also dont know why the color skipped the first row in my summary table
